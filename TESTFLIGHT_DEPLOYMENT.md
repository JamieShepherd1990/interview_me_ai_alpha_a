# TestFlight Deployment Guide - InterviewCoach AI

## ðŸš€ Ready for TestFlight Deployment

Your InterviewCoach AI app is **production-ready** and all code has been committed to git. Here's how to deploy to TestFlight:

### âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist - COMPLETED

- âœ… **All Code Committed**: Latest changes pushed to main branch
- âœ… **Security Audit**: No critical vulnerabilities
- âœ… **API Integration**: OpenAI and ElevenLabs APIs properly configured
- âœ… **Voice Pipeline**: Real-time STT/TTS with barge-in logic
- âœ… **Database**: SQLite with encryption implemented
- âœ… **UI/UX**: Professional theming with dark/light mode
- âœ… **Native Modules**: Safe fallbacks for all platforms
- âœ… **Build Configuration**: EAS build properly configured
- âœ… **App Store Compliance**: Permissions and descriptions set

### ðŸ“± Step-by-Step TestFlight Deployment

#### Step 1: Set Up Apple Developer Credentials

```bash
cd /Users/jamieshepherd/Desktop/interview_me_ai_alpha_a
npx eas credentials
```

**What this does:**
- Authenticates with your Apple Developer account
- Generates/manages signing certificates
- Sets up provisioning profiles
- Validates App Store Connect access

#### Step 2: Create Production Build

```bash
npx eas build --profile production --platform ios
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a production-ready iOS build
- Optimizes code and assets
- Signs the app with distribution certificate
- Uploads build to EAS servers
- Provides download link and build ID

#### Step 3: Submit to TestFlight

```bash
npx eas submit --platform ios
```

**What this does:**
- Automatically submits the latest build to App Store Connect
- Uploads to TestFlight for beta testing
- Sets up for internal/external testing

### ðŸ”§ Alternative: Manual Upload

If EAS submit doesn't work, you can manually upload:

1. Download the `.ipa` file from the EAS build
2. Open **Xcode** or **Transporter** app
3. Upload the `.ipa` to App Store Connect
4. Go to TestFlight in App Store Connect
5. Add internal/external testers

### ðŸ“‹ App Store Connect Configuration

Once uploaded, configure in App Store Connect:

1. **App Information**
   - Name: InterviewCoach AI
   - Bundle ID: com.interviewcoach.ai
   - Primary Language: English

2. **TestFlight Settings**
   - Beta App Description: "AI-powered interview coach with real-time voice feedback"
   - Beta App Review Information: Include test account details
   - Test Information: Explain voice features need microphone access

3. **Internal Testing**
   - Add internal testers (up to 100)
   - No App Store review required
   - Available immediately after processing

4. **External Testing** (Optional)
   - Add external testers (up to 10,000)
   - Requires App Store review
   - Takes 24-48 hours for approval

### ðŸŽ¯ Testing Focus Areas

When testers receive the TestFlight build, have them focus on:

#### Core Functionality
- âœ… Onboarding flow and microphone permissions
- âœ… Voice recording and real-time transcript
- âœ… AI conversation flow (with API keys)
- âœ… Interview completion and feedback
- âœ… Session history and progress tracking

#### Performance Testing
- âœ… Voice latency (target: <2000ms P95)
- âœ… App startup time and responsiveness
- âœ… Memory usage during long sessions
- âœ… Battery impact assessment

#### Platform-Specific Testing
- âœ… iOS permissions handling
- âœ… Background/foreground transitions
- âœ… Device rotation behavior
- âœ… Haptic feedback functionality

### ðŸ”‘ API Keys Setup

For full functionality, testers will need backend API access:

1. **Deploy Backend** (Vercel recommended):
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: Your ElevenLabs API key
   - Update `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in app

3. **Test End-to-End**: Verify complete voice pipeline works

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics

After TestFlight deployment:

1. **TestFlight Metrics**
   - Install rates and crash reports
   - User feedback and ratings
   - Session duration analytics

2. **Backend Monitoring**
   - API response times and error rates
   - Voice pipeline latency metrics
   - Usage patterns and peak times

### ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Build Fails**
   - Check Apple Developer account status
   - Verify bundle identifier is unique
   - Ensure certificates are valid

2. **Upload Fails**
   - Check App Store Connect access
   - Verify app information is complete
   - Try manual upload via Transporter

3. **TestFlight Not Available**
   - Check processing status (can take 10-30 minutes)
   - Verify internal tester invitations
   - Check for compliance issues

### ðŸŽ‰ Success Criteria

Your TestFlight deployment is successful when:

- âœ… Build processes without errors
- âœ… App appears in TestFlight within 30 minutes
- âœ… Internal testers can install and launch
- âœ… Core features work on physical devices
- âœ… Voice pipeline functions with <2000ms latency
- âœ… No critical crashes or blocking issues
