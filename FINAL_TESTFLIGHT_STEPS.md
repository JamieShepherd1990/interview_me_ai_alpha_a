# 🚀 FINAL TESTFLIGHT SUBMISSION STEPS

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Install iOS 18 Platform First**

**You MUST do this step first:**

1. **Open Xcode** (already open)
2. **Xcode → Settings → Components** (or Platforms)
3. **Download iOS 18.0** (this will install iOS 26.0 platform)
4. **Wait for download to complete** (may take 10-15 minutes)

## 🎯 **Option A: Automated Command Line (After iOS 18 installed)**

```bash
cd /Users/jamieshepherd/Desktop/interview_me_ai_alpha_a
./scripts/build-for-appstore.sh
```

## 🎯 **Option B: Manual Xcode (Guaranteed to work)**

**Since Xcode is already open:**

1. **Select "InterviewCoachAI" scheme** (top left dropdown)
2. **Select "Any iOS Device"** (next to scheme dropdown)  
3. **Product → Archive** (or Cmd+Shift+B)
4. **Wait for archive to complete** (~5-10 minutes)
5. **Organizer window opens → "Distribute App"**
6. **Select "App Store Connect"**
7. **Select "Upload"**
8. **Follow prompts** (keep defaults)
9. **Upload completes** → **Ready for TestFlight!**

## 🎯 **Option C: Use Current Working EAS Build (Temporary)**

**If you want to test immediately while waiting for iOS 18:**

```bash
# Download the working IPA from EAS
curl -L -o InterviewCoachAI.ipa "https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/cLM9YQcNJDw7JZcL3sXT4L.ipa"

# Upload manually to App Store Connect website
# Go to: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
# Select your app → TestFlight → Add Build
# Upload the IPA file
```

**Note:** This will be rejected for iOS 18 SDK requirement, but you can test the upload process.
